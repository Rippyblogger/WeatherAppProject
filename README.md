# WeatherAppProject
For my third Udacity Front end web devlopment project, i was tasked with creating an asynchronous web app which uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.

Nodejs, CSS, Javascript and HTML were used in the creating and completion of this project.
